%Developing expertise goes beyond the mere learning of ordinary skills by requiring years of extensive and high-quality training. For skilled performers, such training can improve performance in two fundamental ways depending on its content. If the training honors repetitions of automated solutions, it can still improve the precision with which an action is executed. This learning advances slowly by honing the components underlying the automated solution. Greater strides in improvement can be achieved, however, when training not only aims to improve the execution of a chosen strategy but seeks to find new and better ways to perform a task. Finding such creative and innovative solutions is a hallmark of expertise, yet we know little about which training strategies are most effective in developing these strategies. If superior methods to those currently used in standard practice exist, they could prove invaluable for training both present and future generations of learners.
